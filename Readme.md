# Authenticate Users with a token

## Generate a token with the example code

This section takes `Example.js` as an example to show how to generate a token with the sample code.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have installed a Java IDE.

1. Install the [Rtc-token](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rtc-token) repository.
2. Open the `example.js` file, replace the value of `appID`, `appCertificate`, `channelName`, and `uid` with your own, and comment out the code snippets of `buildTokenWithUid`.
3. Run the example project. Your token is generated and printed in your IDE.
